Focus group feedback
====================

KA
- it’s quite interesting that you don’t have to share or join a session
- in school, on group projects it’s much more relevant
    - start talking to professors: here’s 5 subscriptions, please hand it out to your students
    - computer science labs
- repl.it is pretty slow if not paid version

DS:
- make sure this is NOT for micro-managing teams (looking through commit logs has the same effect, if someone wants to abuse the team)
- requesting help during coding might work better this way
- other solo devs working on those solo projects, they could collaborate and help each other; gamify / assign coins for helping others

JF:
- educator !!!
- port this to JetBrains

MG:
- virtual hackathons

JMW:
- merge conflicts are terrible, would love a tool to prevent that
-

DL:
- removing ambiguity in onboarding, set people up for success
- setting standards for new engineers, coding standards, etc
- came to love Jira: push a commit and the ticket gets updated
- removing unnecessary steps
- naming standards
- pair programming only when a problem is insurmountable
- would like to have the opportunity to ask questions
- important things: mindset, setting expectations, documentation
- it’s good to make mistakes, because you’re learning from it
- no one can sprint forever; every 6 to 8 weeks have a light week
- absolutely necessary to have something like Code Awareness
- there is a way to be helpful to each other, in the middle between real-time and silo work

MK:
- working on a small startup in disaster recovery space - team in India
- was asking about my pricing (!!)
- blind/busy

WB:
- working on AI, team in several countries
- willing to try


MM:
- Standup info can be automated, 90%
- Intrigued that it works with any editor
- Create another channel of communication that git does not offer

MuleSoft : working on a doc 30 - 40 people
- presales management person would be ideal

MV:
- Code review complaints are mostly due to toxic culture
- Lots of examples, here's one: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/bts4t4/unlearning_toxic_behaviors_in_a_code_review/
- What does Code Awareness to address the issues steming from toxic culture?
- Among workflow factors to bad code reviews, the "in-and-out of context" is most common issue among developers.
- There are also psychological factors:
    - lack of clear goals
    - too many choices
    - lack of motivation

MD:
- Collaboration comes at a premium these days
- Devs don’t really communicate well
- Getting constant feedback may help prevent over-engineering
- Mentoring just got a lot easier
- Clean up your agile methodology, or don’t even use it: fewer meetings and pointless ceremonies.

JP:
- needs project management layer on top of github
- using LLM to parse the code changes and offer synthetic info about where the project is going
- progr in Elixir


TB:
- mentorship, async keep in touch with what’s going on in the project
- nice visualization of the real time project progress, code blocks moving around
- “this is one of the most re-written blocks of code, let’s take a look at it as a team and see why”

AO:
- The process is difficult in some companies, requirements, jira issues
- Vscode stumbles in the merge process quite often, when we have to rebase. Sends commits one by one to github and forces you to redo conflict merges several times. 

LAL:
- create more content on the News section, to allow search engines to extract content.

FC:
- devs work on programming for 1 hour and 7 hours on meetings and reports
- do we really want our software devs to be like this
- software is changing the world, so the work style of software dev is crucial to our future
- people thrive in a collaborative environment, rather than isolated
- Zoom / GMeet fatigue
- potential overlap with Linkedin

DT:
- branch comparison is really useful
- Having a large amount of text in a file (AI models) makes it difficult to push and pull just to compare changes. CodeAwareness should be able to help with that.
