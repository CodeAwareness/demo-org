============

At this time we have our channels setup on all major social media platforms, as CodeAwareness, as well as a fully fledged website. However, we haven't started an active campaign yet. Instead we've been gathering feedback from potential users (software engineers, managers, businesses). The feedback was mixed, with people in Japan being reluctant to try it, while most in the US having a positive reaction to the posibility Code Awareness offers.
