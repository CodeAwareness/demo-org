TODO:

- AI asistant that explains the code you're looking at, the file or the project in general
    - onboarding assistant
- Write about security and swarm authentication
- Redefine "possible": cross-app
- Create a secure open interaction on projects
- Self-healing repository: while some commits may disrupt the product functionality, the team works on pushing commits that eventually pass all tests. When a commit that passes all tests is pushed to the cloud, it becomes a tagged release, and you may choose to publish it or not. Who does the merging and pushing of these code blocks? Anyone with permissions to push to the main branch. Once pushed to the cloud repository, Code Awareness updates all peers with new highlights based on the new commit.
    - * we need to run two diffs then, one against the cSHA and one against the most current main branch (perhaps different colors). The one against main branch will identify pieces of code that a peer has changed, that would overwrite recently accepted changes.
- Most engineers don't have the financial resources to take a year off the workforce and focus on their idea. Even worse, during employment and engineer is often working 12 to 16 hours a day, making it impossible to even think of anything else but work. Fractional work could ameliorate this suffering, enabling engineers and other professionals to work on fractions of a project, not necessarily employed by a single company.
    - Question: why do companies insist hiring full time?
- Prettier and other formatting tools are the main obstacle in having personalized formatting. We would need to create yet another formatting tool. And for C family of languages we could use clang-format
