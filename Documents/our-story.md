Our Story
=========

I first got this idea when I was working in Japan for an AI company. One day, we had an urgent request, so our manager gathered all of us together to solve the challenge. We worked together, 2 to 5 people around one computer, coming up with ideas and also doing independent research on our laptops. Everyone agreed afterwards, this was the most fun weâ€™ve ever had doing programming.

I replicated this experiment later on, as an engineering manager with a fully remote team, and got the same results: for a long time my engineers kept mentioning how fun the crisis simulation was.

Code Awareness is the embodiment of this idea, connecting people in their work flow to produce a higher synergy.

What is Code Awareness?

Code Awareness is the SaaS solution to the ever-growing problem of workflow management in the software industry and beyond. Think about collaborating with your team on a PowerPoint file. Today you have two solutions: either everyone changes the same file in real time, and tolerate the chaos that ensues; or you lock the file and allow one person at a time to work on the presentation. Similar solutions exist for code repositories in the software development world.

Code Awareness offers a best-of-both-worlds solution to your workflow: everyone has their own copy of the presentation which they can freely edit anytime, but these different copies are connected via Code Awareness. Therefore, you get to see sections of the document  highlighted where other users have made changes. You can then check their version and pick what you want to integrate into your own copy.

On a similar note, in the software development world we struggle with what we call "merge requests", which is arguably the most problematic stage in releasing a new feature, or a bug fix. With Code Awareness, the code written by different engineers can be preemptively validated and merged as it is written. Each engineer is working on their own copy of the code, but they see highlighted lines of code where other engineers have made changes in their own copy. This is the main point of our innovation which adds value to your team and technology stack. We're also working on adding even more tools to assist your team, including an AI assistant which documents your code as you write it, assists you in creating scope-of-work, implementation plans and more.
